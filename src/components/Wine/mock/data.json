  "vintage": 2009,
  "price": 62,
  "notes": "Nicely expansive flavors of maraschino cherries, boysenberries, earth and fresh spices best illustrate this vintage. A very fruit driven wine, as always, with expressive grape tannins exhibiting great weight in the mouth and finishing long. My final sip finished with a fresh baked cherry pie aftertaste that is accentuated by the balanced acids in this wine. The extracted tannin will soften with several years of patient cellaring."
